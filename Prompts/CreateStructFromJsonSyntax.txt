Please create a USTRUCT called FStructName. 
Use the following json data to create the member variables. 
Add a UPROPERTY() to each variable, and use the property names in the json object as the variable names in the struct. 
For the "string" properties in the json, make the struct variables have the FString type, 
and for the "boolean" properties, make the variable a bool. 
Create a Dump() function for using UE_LOG to log the values, with LogName as the Log type.
Please don't add any UPROPERTY or USTRUCT specifiers. Use GENERATED_BODY() in the struct.
Don't add any access specifiers. Don't make any functions inline.

Here is the json object:  
{ 
  "StringPropertyName": "string",
  "BoolPropertyName": "bool",
}
